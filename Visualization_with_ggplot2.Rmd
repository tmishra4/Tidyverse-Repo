## R Markdown
ggplot2 is an R package for producing statistical, or data, graphics, but it is unlike most other graphics packages because it has a deep underlying grammar.

ggplot comes from the 'grammer of graphics' i.e 'gg'. The idea behind this you create a grapgh piece by piece, something like layer on top of another layer. This makes ggplot2 very powerful because you are not limited to a set of pre-specified graphics, but you can create new graphics that are precisely tailored for your problem.

All the plots are composed of 

1. Layers
2. Scales
3. Coordinate System (coord)
4. Facet
5. Themes

Let's begin the Action .........

The first chunk in an R Notebook is usually titled "setup," and by convention includes the R packages you want to load. Remember, in order to use an R package you have to run some `library()` code every session. Execute these lines of code to load the packages. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

```

Lets begin with a data, I took a Heart disease sample data. The first 13 variables are various health parameters of participants , suggesting they can used as explanatory variables , which can used to predict Heart disease in a patient.

```{r cars}
heart.data <- read.csv("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/processed.cleveland.data",header=FALSE,sep=",",na.strings = '?')
names(heart.data) <- c( "age", "sex", "cp", "trestbps", "chol","fbs", "restecg",
                   "thalach","exang", "oldpeak","slope", "ca", "thal", "target")

#Removing few missing values
heart.data <- na.omit(heart.data)

# Lets check the dimensions of dataframe
dim(heart.data)

```

Now, lets check the structure or datatypes of this sample

```{r}
str(heart.data)

```

Now , we are ready to explore this data. Let's check some rows

```{r}
head(heart.data)
```


Sometimes, people prefer to see their data in a more spreadsheet-like format, and RStudio provides a way to do that. Go to the Console and type `View(heart.data)` to see the data preview.

(An aside-- `View` is a special function. Since it makes something happen in the RStudio interface, it doesn't work properly in R Notebooks. Most R functions have names that start with lowercase letters, so the uppercase "V" is there to remind you of its special status.)

### Consider
What relationship do you expect to see between Age and Cholestrol(chol)?

```{r fig.width=8 , fig.height=3}
ggplot(data=heart.data )  +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = age , y = chol))
```

Remember , '+' indicates you keep on adding layers , This sign should always be end of line.

### Remember this template - Made of 3 layers - Data, GEOM and Aesthetics
ggplot(data = <DATA>) +
<GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))

## 1. Aesthetics

aesthetic means “something you can see”. Each aesthetic is a mapping between a visual cue and a variable. Examples include:

a. position (i.e., on the x and y axes)
b. color (“outside” color)
c. fill (“inside” color)
d. shape (of points)
e. line type
f. size

Each type of geom accepts only a subset of all aesthetics—refer to the geom help pages to see what mappings each geom accepts.

```{r}
ggplot(data= heart.data)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = age , y = chol, color = target))
```

You see the colors as gradient , because target is numeric data type by default. Let us change to factor , inorder to categories this as type of heart disease. 

```{r}
heart.data$target <- factor(heart.data$target,
                    levels = c(0,1,2,3,4),
                    labels = c("No Disease","Severity 1", "Severity 2","Severity 3","Severity 4"))

ggplot(data= heart.data)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = age , y = chol, color = target))
```

Now, the plot has given a distinct color to each level of target variable. 

```{r}
ggplot(data= heart.data)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = age , y = chol, color = target))+
 geom_vline(xintercept = mean(heart.data$age))+
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(heart.data$chol))

```
